        "## Why Numpy?\n",
        "We have seen collections in Python and how useful they are. However, when it comes to handling numerical data, such as storing and computing large arrays or matrices of numbers, collections are not appropriate. The reason for this is that collections can handle heterogenous types of data -- you can have a list with elements that are floats, strings, ints, other lists, etc. This means that the items in a list can't be stored contiguously in memory, making it slower to access each successive item. \n",
        "\n",
        "Numpy allows you to define an array or matrix of elements which are all the same data type (which is often the case for many applications in data science). This means that numpy can store the elements contiguously in memory and also take advantage of many computationally efficient tricks to speed up calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is a comparison of how lists store items in memory compared to how numpy stores an array:\n",
        "\n",
        "![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1dvdA39EgYWkkVX2rJmeq871vVewdXEsU)\n",
        "\n",
        "In a list, pointers to each object (the items) are stored in a contiguous block of memory. A pointer is just the actual memory address where the object itself is located.  Because pointers are a fixed size (e.g., 64 bits), its easy to start at the top and then zip through the memory in chunks of the pointer size (i.e., in 64 bit increments) to get the location of the object you want. \n",
        "\n",
        "In order to access the third item of a list, Python first accesses the location in memory where the pointers to items start and then travel ahead by (3-1)*64 bits, reads the next 64 bits to get the address, and then looks in the memory location at that address to find the object. This involves two reference lookups and jumping around in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, because the elements of a numpy array are all the same type (e.g., a float), they have fixed size and they can all be stored in sequentially in memory.  This means we can read the third element of a numpy array by just looking at the address where the array starts and looking ahead by (3-1)*sizeof(element) and the just reading sizeof(element) bits. This doesn't involve looking to a second location in memory and is therefore much faster.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, numpy implements its routines to process computations in C, which means it can do all sorts of low-level tricks to parallelize computations and take advantage of special linear algebra libraries in C that speedup common matrix operations (such as intel's Math Kernel Library)\n",
