        "A: Python is a high-level programming language. It has nice features like many modern languages that we will talk a bit about (dynamic typing, garbage collection, object orientation, etc). But it is particularly good for scientific programming and data science / business analytics tasks. Part of the reason for this is that it is it is (canonically) an interpretive language -- which means you run the code \"line by line\" and get a response from each \"line\" -- as opposed to a compiled language where _all the code_ you write is seen and then compiled and run to get an output.   \n",

This class was designed for people with varying backgrounds with the expectation that some students will have a good deal of experience with Python while others may have very little to none. We will take a couple classes to do some review of basic Python and to make sure everyone is on the same page. There will be opportunities for you to challenge yourself, even for these first few classes. Keep in mind that you control your own pace through this notebook. If you feel confident that you know all this stuff, jump straight to the STOP sign pictures that you will see scattered throughout the notebook and try to do these interactive exercises.  \n",

If you click the play button next to a \"cell\" of code, it will instruct the server machine to execute that line of code in a shell that is awaiting input and then send the output back to the browser.  Google provides a Jupyter notebook environment that is connected to Google's cloud computing service that you can use for free (with some limitations) through colab.research.google.com.
